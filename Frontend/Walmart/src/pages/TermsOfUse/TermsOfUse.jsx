            <p className="my-3">Last Updated March 5, 2024</p>
            <p>Please review these Terms of Use carefully.</p>
            <p className="my-3">IMPORTANT: THESE TERMS OF USE CONTAIN A MANDATORY ARBITRATION PROVISION THAT, AS FURTHER SET FORTH IN SECTION 20 BELOW, REQUIRES THE USE OF ARBITRATION ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS TO RESOLVE DISPUTES. THIS MEANS THAT YOU AND WALMART ARE EACH GIVING UP THE RIGHT TO SUE EACH OTHER IN COURT OR IN CLASS ACTIONS OF ANY KIND. IN ARBITRATION, THERE IS NO JUDGE OR JURY AND THERE IS LESS DISCOVERY AND APPELLATE REVIEW THAN IN COURT.</p>
            <h1 className="text-xl font-bold ">1. Introduction</h1>
            <p className="my-3">Welcome to the family of websites and applications provided by Walmart. These Terms of Use govern your access to and use of all Walmart Sites among other things. By using the Walmart Sites, you affirm that you are of legal age to enter into these Terms of Use, or, if you are not, that you have obtained parental or guardian consent to enter into these Terms of Use and your parent or guardian consents to these Terms of Use on your behalf. If you violate or do not agree to these Terms of Use, then your access to and use of the Walmart Sites is unauthorized. Additional terms and conditions apply to some services offered on the Walmart Sites (e.g., Walmart Pharmacy, Walmart +, and Gift Cards) or through other channels. Those terms and conditions can be found where the relevant service is offered on the Walmart Sites or otherwise and are incorporated into these Terms of Use by reference.</p>
            <h1 className="text-xl font-bold ">DEFINED TERMS:</h1>
            <p>In these Terms of Use:</p>

(including any subsidiaries that Walmart Inc. may form or acquire in the future), and their affiliates, directors, officers, employees and agents. We also refer to Walmart as “we,” “us” and “our.” But when we say “Walmart Entities,” we mean Walmart; its suppliers, vendors, contractors, and licensors.
When we say “Walmart Sites,” we mean www.walmart.com, the Walmart Apps, and all related functionality, services, and Content offered by or for Walmart on or through www.walmart.com and the Walmart Apps or the systems, servers, and networks used to make the Walmart Sites available.
When we say “Walmart Apps,” we mean the official “Walmart App” for iPhone and Android, which can be downloaded from the iTunes App Store or the Google Play Store.
When we say “you” or “your” we mean any user (like you!) of any Walmart Site and any person who has notice of these Terms of Use.

A few other key terms used in these Terms of Use:
When we say “Content,” we mean merchandise information, product descriptions, reviews, comments, messages, reviews, communications, feedback, submissions, suggestions, questions, and other information, data, content, and materials (including page headers, images, text, illustrations, formats, logos, hashtags, designs, icons, photographs, software programs, music clips or downloads, video clips, and written and other materials.)

When we say “Materials,” we mean Content that Walmart Entities make available on or through the Walmart Sites, including In Store Now information.
WARRANTY DISCLAIMERS AND LIABILITY LIMITATIONS: While there are important points throughout these Terms of Use, please note the warranty disclaimers and limitations on Walmart’s liability explained in Sections 17 and 18, respectively.

UPDATES: We may update these Terms of Use from time to time by notifying you of such changes by any reasonable means, including by posting a revised Terms of Use through the Walmart Sites. Any such changes will not apply to any dispute between you and us arising prior to the date on which we posted the revised Terms of Use incorporating such changes or otherwise notified you of such changes. You agree that it your responsibility to regularly check Walmart.com for any updated Terms of Use. In addition, by continuing to use or access any of the Walmart Sites or otherwise engaging with Walmart after we post any changes, you accept the updated Terms of Use. The “Last Updated” legend above indicates when these Terms of Use were last changed.</p>

<h1 className="text-xl font-bold ">5. Materials Available on the Walmart Sites</h1>
<p>Walmart and its suppliers and licensors may make available various Materials. The Materials are for educational and informational purposes only, and errors may appear from time to time. Before you act in reliance on any Materials, you should confirm any facts that are important to your decision. The Walmart Entities make no warranty as to the reliability, accuracy, timeliness, usefulness, or completeness of any Materials. If you find an error or notice something that does not look quite right on the Walmart Sites, we would appreciate it if you let us know by contacting us at http://www.walmart.com/help (Your feedback is a big part of what helps Walmart to get better at helping you!) NO MATERIALS RELATED TO HEALTH, WELLNESS, PRESCRIPTIONS, OR PHARMACEUTICALS ARE INTENDED TO SUBSTITUTE FOR THE DIAGNOSIS, TREATMENT AND ADVICE OF A MEDICAL PROFESSIONAL, AND SUCH MATERIALS DO NOT COVER ALL POSSIBLE USES, PRECAUTIONS, SIDE EFFECTS, AND INTERACTIONS, AND SHOULD NOT BE CONSTRUED TO INDICATE THAT ANY DRUG IS SAFE OR EFFECTIVE FOR YOU. CONSULT THE PRODUCT INFORMATION (INCLUDING PACKAGE INSERTS) REGARDING DOSAGE, PRECAUTIONS, WARNINGS, AND INTERACTIONS, AND YOUR MEDICAL PROFESSIONAL, FOR GUIDANCE BEFORE USING ANY PRESCRIPTION OR OVER-THE-COUNTER DRUG.

THE WALMART ENTITIES ASSUME NO RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY CONSEQUENCE RELATING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY TO ANY ACTION OR INACTION YOU TAKE BASED ON THE MATERIALS.</p>

<h1 className="text-xl font-bold ">6. Merchandise</h1>
<p>The Sites may make available listings, descriptions, and images of goods and services (collectively, “Products”). Such Products may be made available by us or by third parties. We make no representations as to the completeness, accuracy, reliability, validity, or timeliness of such listings, descriptions, or images (including any features, specifications, and prices contained on the Sites). Such information and the availability of any Product are subject to change at any time without notice.

We have made efforts to accurately display the attributes of Products, including the applicable colors. However, as the actual colors you see will depend on your monitor, we cannot guarantee that your monitor's display of any color will accurately reflect actual product color or finish. In addition, certain weights, measures, and similar descriptions are approximate and are for convenience only.

We sell Products for children’s use; however, these Products are intended for sale to adults.

Walmart has no liability to you for content on the Walmart Sites that you find to be offensive, indecent, or objectionable. Certain videos, movies, TV programs, video games, computer games, and other Products are labeled with age restrictions or are intended for individuals of certain ages or “mature audiences” only. By ordering an age restricted item, you certify that you satisfy the age restrictions.

Walmart is not responsible for, and cannot guarantee the performance of, goods and services provided by third parties, including any Walmart Entity, Marketplace Retailer (as defined below in Section 16.A), our advertisers, or other third parties to whose sites we link. While our goal is to provide accurate information, product packaging and material may contain more and/or different information than that provided on Walmart Sites, including the product description, country of origin, nutrition, ingredient, allergen, and other information. Always read labels, warnings, directions, and other information provided with the product before using or consuming the product. For additional information about a product, please contact the manufacturer. Information and statements regarding dietary supplements have not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration and are not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease or health condition. If you find a product is not as described, your sole remedy is to return it in unused condition (excluding products that are not eligible for return), in accordance with Walmart’s return policy. It is your responsibility to ascertain and obey all applicable local, state, federal, and foreign laws (including minimum age requirements) regarding the purchase, possession, and use of any Product.</p>

<h1 className="text-xl font-bold ">7. Third Party Sites</h1>
<p>References on Walmart Sites to any names, marks, products, or services of third parties, or links to third-party sites or information, are not an endorsement, sponsorship, or recommendation of the third party or its information, products, or services. Walmart is not responsible for the content of any third-party linked site or any link contained in a linked site, including any third-party social media or mobile app platform with which the Walmart Sites operate or otherwise interact, nor is Walmart responsible for the acts or omissions of any operator of any such site or platform. Your use of any such third-party site or platform is at your own risk, and will be governed by such third party's terms and policies (including its privacy policy).</p>

<h1 className="text-xl font-bold ">8. Placing an Order</h1>
<h1 className="text-sm font-bold ">A. Order Acceptance and Billing</h1>
<p>You represent and warrant that you have the right to use any credit card or other means of payment that you provide to us. By providing payment card information to us, you authorize us to store and use the card as a payment method for purchases made through your Walmart.com account, including on Walmart affiliated sites and properties which you access via your Walmart.com account credentials. Walmart participates in account update services offered by some banks. If your bank participates in account updater services, these services will automatically update your card number or expiration date in our system when it changes. If you do not want to have your cards automatically updated, you can opt out of these services by contacting your issuing bank. All billing information you provide to us must be truthful and accurate. Providing any untruthful or inaccurate information is a breach of these Terms of Use and may result in cancellation of your order. Prior to accepting an order we may also request additional information from you. Verification of information may be required prior to the acknowledgment or completion of any purchase. We reserve the right to refuse or cancel an order for any reason including limitations on quantities available for purchase, inaccuracies, or errors in product or pricing information, or problems identified by our credit and fraud avoidance department. If your order is canceled after your credit card (or other payment account) has been charged, we will issue a credit to your credit card (or other applicable payment account) in the amount of the charge. We will attempt to contact you if all or any portion of your order is canceled or if additional information is required to accept your order. Walmart may request a pre-authorization for some orders placed online with a credit or debit card. This pre-authorization will not be billed to you; however, your card issuer may hold this amount for a short period. Your card issuer determines the length of time the pre-authorization is held. We do this to ensure that the card details are still valid and that you have sufficient funds to complete the transaction.

By confirming your purchase at the end of the checkout process, you agree to accept and pay for the Products, as well as all shipping and handling charges and applicable taxes and fees. You will not be charged for most orders until the order has shipped. Some exceptions (when you will be charged at the time your order is placed) are: (i) orders or preorders paid for with a Gift Card, eGift Card, or PayPal account; and (ii) orders paid using the in-store “Cash” payment method.

Walmart reserves the right, including without prior notice, to limit the quantity of items purchased per person, per household, or per order for any reason. We will attempt to notify you should such limits be applied. Walmart also reserves the right, at our sole discretion, to prohibit sales to dealers or resellers. For purposes of these Terms of Use, “reselling” will be defined as purchasing or intending to purchase any Product(s) from Walmart for the purpose of engaging in a commercial sale of the same Product(s) to a third party.

In addition to any other remedies available to it, Walmart may in its sole discretion restrict or terminate your account, or cancel or refuse orders for violations of, or abuse of the Walmart returns policy.</p>

<h1 className="text-sm font-bold ">B. Pricing Information; Availability</h1>
<p>Walmart cannot confirm the price or availability of an item until after your order is placed. Pricing or availability errors may occur on the Walmart Sites or through Marketplace Retailers. The receipt of an order confirmation does not constitute our acceptance of an order or our confirmation of an offer to sell a Product. Walmart reserves the right to cancel any orders containing pricing or availability errors, with no further obligations to you, even after your receipt of an order confirmation or shipping notice from Walmart. Walmart may, at its discretion, either contact you for instructions or cancel your order and notify you of such cancellation. Pricing for products may be different on the Walmart Sites or from prices available in Walmart stores or on Walmart Apps</p>

<h1 className="text-sm font-bold ">C. Promotional Codes</h1>
<p>Promotional codes are limited in nature and may expire or be discontinued with or without notice. Promotional codes are void where prohibited by law. Promotional codes may not be copied, sold, or otherwise transferred. They are not redeemable for cash and are subject to cancellation or change at any time for any reason without notice. We reserve the right in our discretion to impose conditions on the offering of any promotional code.</p>

<h1 className="text-sm font-bold ">D. Gift Cards</h1>
<p>The risk of loss and title to any gift cards passes to the purchaser upon our electronic transmission to the recipient or delivery to the carrier, whichever is applicable. Your purchase and use of gift cards is subject to the full terms and conditions related to gift cards, available at https://walmart.com/help/article/Gift-Card-Terms-and-Conditions/9881a4e10ab24dbe8f406df5c75acefd.</p>

<h1 className="text-sm font-bold ">E. Tax Exempt Purchases</h1>
<p>To obtain tax-exempt purchasing privileges for purchases on Walmart.com, you must follow the tax-exempt registration procedure as described on the Site. As part of this process, you may be required to provide additional information to Walmart to confirm your tax-exempt status (for example, a valid state tax-exempt number). You represent and warrant that any information you provide to Walmart as part of the tax-exempt registration process is valid, accurate, and complete. You will promptly notify Walmart of any updates or changes to your tax-exempt status and will promptly provide Walmart with any updated information or documentation. If you purchase any products or services for a tax-exempt purpose and use those products or services for any other purpose, you will report and pay all taxes required under applicable law. If you are a tax-exempt organization, all tax-exempt purchases must be used exclusively by your organization for tax-exempt purposes only. You will comply with all other applicable requirements for tax-exempt purchases under applicable law. You will hold Walmart harmless from and will indemnify Walmart against any claim, loss or expense occurring from any failure to comply with your resale permits or any other tax-exempt requirements, and your exemption will be subject to immediate cancellation.

You further agree that if you do not use the products or services purchased with your tax-exempt account for the purpose for which your tax exemption applies, you will report and pay sales and use taxes directly to the state relating to the products or services to the extent required by law. In order to qualify for exemption, you may be required by law to pay us using your organization’s payment method (e.g., a company credit card) and not a personal payment method (e.g., a personal credit card). To the extent you have a Business Account, you acknowledge that if you, or any business user accounts associated with your Business Account, make tax exempt purchases with a tax exemption certificate associated with the Business Account, that those purchases are made with the tax-exempt organization’s funds. You will comply with such requirement to the extent required by law.</p>

<h1 className="text-xl font-bold ">9. Shipping and Delivery</h1>
<p>Products will be shipped to an address designated by you, if applicable, so long as such address is complete and complies with the shipping restrictions contained on the Walmart Sites. All transactions are made pursuant to a shipping contract, and, as a result, risk of loss and title for Products pass to you upon delivery of the Products to the carrier.

Delivery of Products purchased from the Walmart Sites to addresses outside the United States is limited. Some Products also have restricted delivery within the United States. Some Products may be available for pick up at physical Walmart store locations. Estimated delivery times are determined based on the method of shipping chosen when Products are purchased and the destination of the Products.</p>

<h1 className="text-xl font-bold ">10. Export Policy</h1>
<p>You acknowledge that (a) goods licensed or sold on the Walmart Sites, and (b) any software or technology purchased, downloaded, or used from the Walmart Sites, are subject to the customs and export control laws and regulations of the United States of America and may also be subject to the customs and export laws and regulations of the country in which the products are manufactured and/or received, and you agree to comply with all applicable laws. You agree, represent, and warrant that no Materials will be accessed from, downloaded in, released in, carried to, transferred to, transshipped through, exported to, or re-exported (collectively “transferred”) to any territory (or national resident thereof), person, entity, or organization to which such Materials could not be transferred directly from the United States or by a U.S. person without a license, including without limitation to any person on the U.S. Treasury Department’s List of Specially Designated Nationals or the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Denied Persons List or Entity List.</p>
